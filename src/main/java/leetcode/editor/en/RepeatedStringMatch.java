  //Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeat
//ed such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1. 
//
// For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab". 
//
// Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substri
//ng of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd"). 
//
// Note: 
//The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.
